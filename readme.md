These are self-printable adaptors for use with a Kopf 1900 (previously Cartesian) stereotaxic frame. 

1. Nanoject holder
- Used for a Drummond Nanoject III, with glass capillaries, but will likely fit other Nanoject models. 
- Printed on a filament printer (MakerGear M2)
- This is not concentric with other 1900 devices (to be improved in a later model)

2. Drill bit adaptor
- This is a cone that inserts into the 1900 drill to fit other sized drill bits
- Printed with an Asiga PICO2 UV 39 um resin printer

3. Fiber holder
- To hold fiberoptic ferules with suction during implantation
- Needs to be slightly enlarged (slightly frictive fit at present)
- Printed with an Asiga PICO2 UV 39 um resin printer
- Attached to a Plastics1 stereotaxic adaptor and 1/8 inch tubing for suction
